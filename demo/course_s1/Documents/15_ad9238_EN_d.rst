18.1 Hardware Introduction
============================================
18.1.1 Two-channel AD module description
----------------------------------------
The black gold high-speed AD module AN9238 is a 2-way 65MSPS, 12-bit analog signal to digital signal module. The AD conversion of the module adopts the AD9238 chip of ADI Company, and the AD9238 chip supports 2-way AD input conversion, so one piece of AD9238 chip supports 2-way AD input conversion in total. Analog signal input supports single-ended analog signal input, the input voltage range is -5V~+5V, and the interface is SMA socket.

The module has a 40-pin female header with a standard 2.54mm pitch, which is used to connect to the FPGA development board. The physical photos of the AN9238 module are as follows:

Please refer to the AD9238 chip manual for the specific reference design of the AD9238 circuit.

1) Single-ended input and operational amplifier circuit

Single-ended input AD1 and AD2 are input through two SMA heads of J5 or J6, and the voltage of single-ended input is -5V~+5V.

On the board, the input voltage of -5V~+5V is reduced to -1V~+1V through the op amp AD8065 chip and the voltage divider resistor. If the user wants to input a wider range of voltage input, just modify the resistance of the front-end voltage divider resistor.

The following table is the analog input signal and the voltage comparison table after the AD8065 op amp output:

   :header: "AD analog input value", "AD8065 op amp output"
   :widths: 40, 40


   "-5V","-1V"
   "0V","0V"
   "+5V","+1V"


2) Single-ended to differential and AD conversion

The input voltage of -1V~+1V is converted into a differential signal (VIN+ − VIN−) by the AD8138 chip, and the common mode level of the differential signal is determined by the CML pin of the AD.

The following table is the voltage comparison table after the analog input signal to the AD8138 differential output:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "AD analog input value", "AD8065 operational amplifier output", "AD8138 differential output (VIN+−VIN−)"
   :widths: 30, 30, 30


   "-5V ",-1V ,"-1V"
   "0V ",0V ,"0V "
   "+5V ",+1V ,"+1V"



3) AD9238 conversion

The default AD is configured as offset binary, and the AD conversion value is shown in the following figure:

.. image:: images/images_18/image5.png
    :align: center

In the module circuit design, the VREF value of AD9238 is 1V, so the final analog signal input and AD conversion data are as follows:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "AD analog input value", "AD8055 op amp output", "AD8138 differential output (VIN+−VIN−)", "AD9238 digital output"
   :widths: 30, 30, 30, 30


   "-5V ",-1V ,-1V ,"000000000000"
   "0V ",0V ,0V ,"100000000000"
   "+5V ",+1V ,+1V ,"11111111111"

We can see from the table that when -5V is input, the digital value converted by AD9238 is the smallest, and when +5V is input, the digital value converted by AD9238 is the largest.


4) AD9238 digital output timing

The digital output of the AD9238 dual-channel AD is a +3.3V CMOS output mode, and 2 channels (A and B) have independent data and clock. The AD data converts data on the rising and falling edges of the clock, and the FPGA side can sample AD data with the AD clock.

18.2 Programming
============================================
The display part of this experiment is based on the previous HDMI display color bar experiment, and grid lines and waveforms are superimposed on the color bar. The block diagram of the entire project is shown in the figure below:

The ad9238_sample module mainly completes the single-channel data conversion of AN9238. The final data only takes the high 8-bit data, and the data width is converted to 8bit (in order to be compatible with other 8-bit AD module programs). In addition, collect 1280 data each time, and then wait for a period of time before continuing to collect the following 1280 data.

The grid_display module mainly completes the grid line superposition of the video image. In this experiment, the color bar video is input, and then a grid is superimposed and output. This grid area is provided for the subsequent waveform display module. This grid area is located at the display level. Direction (from left to right) from 9 to 1018, vertical direction (from top to bottom) from 9 to 308 video display position.

grid_display module port

The wav_display display module mainly completes the superposition display of waveform data. The module contains a dual-port ram, the write port is written by the ADC acquisition module, and the read port is the display module. When the grid display area is valid, each line of display will read the AD data value stored in RAM, and compare it with the Y coordinate to determine whether to display the waveform or not.
